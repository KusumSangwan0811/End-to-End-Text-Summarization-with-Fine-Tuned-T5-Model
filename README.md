# End-to-End Text Summarization with Fine-Tuned T5 Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for text summarization using the T5 Transformer model, fine-tuned on a custom dataset. The T5 model, based on the Transformer architecture, is renowned for its capabilities in sequence-to-sequence tasks, making it ideal for tasks like summarization.

## Key Features
- **Fine-Tuning**: The T5 model is fine-tuned on a specific dataset for abstractive summarization.
- **Model Saving**: After fine-tuning, the model and tokenizer are saved locally for future deployment.
- **Deployment with Gradio**: The fine-tuned T5 model is deployed as a web application using Gradio, allowing users to input text and receive summarized outputs in real-time.
  
## Components
- **Transformer Model**: Utilizes the T5 model from Hugging Face Transformers library, adapted for summarization tasks.
- **Tokenizer**: Handles text tokenization and preparation for model input.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the summarization model.
  
## Usage
1. **Fine-Tuning**: Customize the T5 model by fine-tuning it on your dataset using the provided training script.
2. **Saving Models**: Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer after training for future deployment.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web app using Gradio for easy access and usability.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on your backend for Hugging Face Transformers)
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Gradio
